# Players - Test Project in CakePHP

Installation

br
1) Import DB from sql folder
br
2) Change the database details according to your setup in Config/database.php
br
3) Admin Credentials
br
	- email: admin@akhil.com
br
	- password: 123456
br
	If you want to change password, there is no facility in the application but you can always do that using tools like phpmyadmin. It is md5() encrypted.
br
br
NOTES:
br
br
1) DB used is MySQL
br
2) I have not used ajax to update points because of time constraint as it will require additional validation and filtering.
