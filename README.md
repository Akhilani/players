# Players - Test Project in CakePHP

Installation

1. Import DB from sql folder
2. Change the database details according to your setup in Config/database.php
3. Admin Credentials<br>
email: admin@akhil.com <br>
password: 123456<br>
If you want to change password, there is no facility in the application but you can always do that using tools like phpmyadmin. It is md5() encrypted.<br>

NOTES:

1. DB used is MySQL
2. I have not used ajax to update points because of time constraint as it will require additional validation and filtering.
